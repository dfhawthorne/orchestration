# 2023-11-08: Using Jenkins

## Overview

I need to build environments using multiple GIT repositories.

## Table of Contents

* [Purpose](#purpose)
* [Separate Repository](#separate-repository)
* [Choice of Language](#choice-of-language)

## Purpose

With the issue ([Oracle user missing on server rebuild #4](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/goldengate/issues/4)), I encountered an orchestration that spanned three (3) repositories:

1. [xen_server_farm](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/xen_server_farm)
1. [oracle-db-build](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/oracle-db-build)
1. [goldengate](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/goldengate)

I need an orchestration that recreates the required environment.

## Separate Repository

A separate repository is chosen so that the overall orchestration is located in a central place.

## Choice of Language

I chose [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io) because this is an opportunity to learn another automation language.
