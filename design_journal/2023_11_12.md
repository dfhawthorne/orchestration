## Location of Scripts

I have created a directory called `scripts` and added an exception to `.gitignore`.

No consideration of other names was done.

A separate directory was created to avoid clutter at the top level directory and to simplify GIT management of scripts.

## Script to Build XEN Server Farm

The script is called `build_xen_server_farm.sh`. I used the simplest name I could think of.

The script runs BASH - not necessary as the script merely changes directory to the local GIT repository for `xen_server_farm`, and invokes `ansible-playbook` to build `sites.yml`.

## Potential Bugs

The directories are hard-coded in scripts.
