# 2023-11-28: Complete GoldenGate Classic Orchestration

I have completed the orchestration of a GoldenGate 19 Classic cluster build from gold images to installing and patching the Oracle RDBMS and GoldenGate software.

I have added a playbook to copy the SSH keys to the GoldenGate hosts, if needed, and added a variable to choose type of GoldenGate installation:

* `classic`
* `microservices`
