# 2023-12-23: Install Terraform

## Overview

With the acquisition of my OCI free account, I wanted to expand my knowledge of infrastructure provisiong tools, in particular, [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform). I also to automate the installation of Terraform onto my automation server, `AUBURN`.

## Choice of Infrastructure Provisioning Tool

The tutorials involving OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) appear to centre around Ansible and Terraform. Since I have been using and developing in Ansible for several years now, it is time to try Terraform for provisioning in the Cloud.

## Choice of Automation Host

I chose `AUBURN` as the host to install Terraform on because:

* I don't think Terraform will conflict with Ansible
* A new host just for Terraform seems to be overkill
* This leaves the possibility of combining Ansible and Terraform worklflows on the same host

## Choice of GIT Repository

I chose to put the installation of Terraform into this repository (`orchestration`) because this function somewhat aligns with the purpose of this repository. This decision can be reversed later, if need be.

## Script Name

I named the installation script as `install_terraform.yml` as the name succiently describes the script's function.
