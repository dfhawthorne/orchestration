## Summary

Now that I have TerraForm installed on `AUBURN`, I need to set up the OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) environment.

## Reference

I am following the tutorial in [Terraform: Set Up OCI Terraform](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/developer-tutorials/tutorials/tf-provider/01-summary.htm).

## Script Used

I am extending the script, `install_terraform.yml`, instead of creating a new one as the functionality seems to belong there.

The disadvantage is that problems will arise if I decide to use TerraForm outside of the OCI environment.

## Global Variables

I set up three (3) global variables:

1. `hashicorp_keyring` is the name for the location where the HashiCorp GPG key is stored. No alternative names were considered.
1. `oci_private_key` is the name for the location where the RSA private key used to communicate with Compute instances in OCI.
1. `oci_public_key` is the public key location corresponding to `oci_private_key`.

## Extra Linux Package

I added `openssl` to the list of Linux packages to be installed.

## Extra Steps in Script

The extra steps follow the reference above.
